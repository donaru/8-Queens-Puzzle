# 8-Queens-Puzzle
8 Queens puzzle

This program uses a recursive backtracking algorithm to solve the 8 Queens problem. The solve function is called with the row number as the argument, and it places a queen in the current row and column. If all 8 queens are placed successfully, the solution is printed by the print_solution function. If a queen cannot be placed in the current row and column, the function returns and tries another column in the same row.
